## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* DONT KNOW IF THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE ASKING FOR BUT
Challenge 3: calling the properties took a long while to remember how to do and is the main reason challenge 3 took so long. slight challenge in appending it as well but that was resolved pretty quickly. 
Challenge 7: Not in building, but in submitting. One of the links on the prework website submission page doesn't work.
